Project 3

Objectives : 

1. **Customer Segmentation**: Identify distinct customer segments based on demographics.

2. **Understanding Customer Needs**: Gain insights into the preferences, behaviors, and concerns of different customer segments and understand their motivations for purchasing products and engaging with the company.

3. **Optimizing Marketing Strategies**: Tailor marketing strategies and campaigns to target specific customer segments more effectively. Determine which marketing channels (e.g., website, catalog, store) are most effective for different customer segments.

4. **Product Development and Customization**: Use customer insights to refine existing products or develop new ones that better meet the needs and preferences of target customer segments. For example, adjust product features, pricing, or packaging to appeal to different customer groups.

5. **Improving Customer Experience**: Identify opportunities to enhance the overall customer experience, such as by offering personalized promotions, improving customer service based on common complaints, or optimizing the online shopping experience.

**Data Description** 
The dataset contains a total of 29 columns and 2240 rows. It contains a mix of categorical and non-categorical data that can be used to gain deeper insights regarding the customers, thier behaviours and shopping patterns. 

Categorical Variables:  Education, Marital_Status, Kidhome, Teenhome, AcceptedCmp3, AcceptedCmp4, AcceptedCmp5, AcceptedCmp1,AcceptedCmp2, Complain, Response
Non-Categorical Variables: Id, Year_Birth, Income, Dt_Customer, Recency, MntWines, MntFruits, MntMeatProducts, MntFishProducts, MntSweetProducts,MntGoldProds, NumDealsPurchases, NumWebPurchases, NumCatalogPurchases, NumStorePurchases, NumWebVisitsMonth, Z_CostContact, Z_Revenue

**Data Preprocessing**

Missing data treatment: Imputation of missing values using descriptive statistics such as mean for numerical variables and mode for categorical variables.
Outlier detection and treatment: Identification and handling of outliers in non-categorical variables.
Normalization and log transformation: Transformation techniques applied to prepare the data for modeling.
Missing data treatment involves filling in missing values using statistical measures like mean for numerical variables and mode for categorical variables. This ensures that the dataset remains complete and usable for analysis, preventing the loss of valuable information due to missing observations. Outlier detection identifies extreme values in non-categorical variables that deviate significantly from the majority of data points. Handling outliers involves either removing them or transforming them to reduce their impact on statistical analyses and predictive models, ensuring more robust and accurate results.

Normalization standardizes the scale of numerical variables, bringing them to a common scale to facilitate fair comparisons and interpretation. Log transformation is a technique applied to skewed data distributions to make them more symmetrical, improving the performance of certain statistical analyses and machine learning algorithms. These preprocessing steps are essential for preparing the data for modeling, ensuring that it meets the assumptions and requirements of statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms. By addressing missing data, outliers, and skewed distributions, preprocessing enhances the quality and reliability of subsequent analyses and predictions.

Overall, data preprocessing plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and usability of the dataset for analytical purposes. It lays the foundation for accurate modeling and meaningful insights, ultimately contributing to informed decision-making and improved outcomes in various domains.

**Data Analysis**

K-Means Clustering: The evaluation metrics provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the clustering algorithm with 5 clusters. The Silhouette Score, measuring the cohesion and separation of clusters, yields a value of 0.2775, indicating a moderate level of similarity within clusters and distinction between them. On the other hand, the Davies-Bouldin Score, which assesses the similarity of clusters relative to each other, returns a score of 1.2908, suggesting that the clusters are reasonably separated and have similar sizes. These metrics collectively indicate that the clustering with 5 clusters demonstrates a satisfactory level of grouping, with clusters showing discernible boundaries and comparable characteristics. Overall, these evaluations suggest that the clustering algorithm has effectively partitioned the data into distinct groups, providing valuable insights into the underlying structure of the dataset.

Decision Tree & Random Forest: The accuracy scores for the Decision Tree Classifier and the Random Forest Classifier are 0.84375 and 0.8660714285714286, respectively. These scores represent the proportion of correctly predicted instances by each model. The higher accuracy score of the Random Forest Classifier (0.8661) compared to the Decision Tree Classifier (0.84375) suggests that the Random Forest model performs slightly better in making accurate predictions on the given dataset. 

XGBoost :The XGBoost classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 86.6%, indicating its decent performance. However, it excelled in identifying non-response instances (class 0) with high precision (89%) and recall (96%), but struggled with response instances (class 1), showing lower precision (62%) and recall (35%). Consequently, the F1-score for class 1 is notably lower (0.44) compared to class 0 (0.92). Despite these disparities, weighted average metrics provide a balanced assessment, considering the support for each class. In summary, while the model performs well in some areas, particularly in identifying non-response cases, there's a clear need for improvement in accurately capturing response instances.




**Managerial Insights** 

The clustering analysis suggests that the customer base can be segmented into distinct groups based on their characteristics and behaviors. This information can be valuable for targeted marketing strategies, product customization, and customer relationship management initiatives. 

The classification models indicate that it is possible to predict customer responses to marketing campaigns with a reasonable degree of accuracy using the available features. This insight can help optimize marketing efforts by targeting specific customer segments more effectively and allocating resources efficiently. 

By leveraging advanced analytics techniques such as clustering and classification, businesses can gain valuable insights into customer behavior, preferences, and responses, ultimately driving more effective marketing strategies and enhancing overall business performance.
